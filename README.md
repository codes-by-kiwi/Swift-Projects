## Random Photo Generator App

A random photo generator app which contains an image frame where the image changes whenever the user clicks the button located on the bottom center.The button is connected to a photo generator function using a selector tag.

## jeanShop

A digital and touch - sensitive shop that allows users to buy jeans. ith this app, multiple jean options (or product cards) are made available to customers and they can click the round plus option on top of each product card to add a specific item to the cart. In the cart view, a customer can see what is added to a cart as well as their total payment amount. Furthermore, a customer can also remove items from the cart and see the difference in total payment amount. Different sizes of app icons are also made to adjust to different user environments and to make the application attractive to use. 

## ToDoList App

An app that allows users to enter tasks they need to complete everyday. I made a to do list in Swift with which you can add entries using the plus button on top, delete a specific entry when you swipe right on it and also allows you to rearrange multiple entries when you click the organize or folder button on top. Data persistence here is managed by saving data to a disk or writing to a file URL. 

## Calculator App

I generated a calculator that performs different functions such as addition, division, multiplication , subtraction and percentage. All of these functions and numbers are added as buttons using an enum list type. The functions are made to work using switch statements and different kinds of numbers, mainly the running number and the current value. The running number is the previous number gotten on the calculator screen and the current value is the number currently being typed onto the screen.

## Reminders App

I created an app that sends reminders or notifications to users even when its turned off or running in the background only. This was achieved using the app's internal notification settings that tells whether the system has authorized the application to give notifications.
